This paper focuses on the KIA EV6, one of TIME’s best inventions of 2023. It will explore the vehicle’s
 predecessor in innovation, apply the Bass Diffusion Model to estimate its adoption, and forecast the number
 of global users.
 Although electric vehicles are generally expensive, KIA’s EV6 GT—named the 2023 World Performance Car
 at the World Car Awards—stands out as an affordable alternative, costing nearly half of what other EVs do
 without compromising on performance. The EV6 GT accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.4 seconds,
 reaches a top speed of 260 kph, and even includes a “drift mode” (TIME, 2023).
 Kia’s EV6 GT encapsulates the brand’s philosophy, which centers around the idea that movement drives
 human progress. It seeks to empower people to explore new destinations, form meaningful connections, and
 embrace fresh experiences. Kia aims to inspire its customers by offering innovative products, immersive
 vehicle interiors, and services that free up time for personal pursuits (TIME, 2023).
 A comparable past innovation is Tesla’s electric vehicle series. Both the KIA EV6 GT and Tesla mod
els represent a strong commitment to electric mobility, offering environmentally friendly alternatives to
 gasoline-powered vehicles. These brands focus on sustainability, integrating advanced technology to enhance
 performance, efficiency, and the overall driving experience. They also share sleek, futuristic designs that
 reflect a modern approach to vehicle aesthetics. Moreover, both the KIA EV6 GT and Tesla aim to de
liver a premium driving experience, offering responsive handling, cutting-edge safety features, and luxurious
 interiors. Together, they play a crucial role in the ongoing shift toward more sustainable transportation
 solutions.
 For the analysis of look-alike innovation, sales data from 2014 to 2023, obtained from Statista, will be used
 for comparison and Bass Model diffusion estimations.
